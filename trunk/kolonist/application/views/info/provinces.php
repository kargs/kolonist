<p>The world map is divided into provinces. You get one province with some resources when you start the game. Your goal is to create an army and in order to take over other provinces. When you click on your province the window will show up with detail information about its resources and buildings. When you click on the province controller by the enemy or an unowned province, you will see some basic information and you will be able to attack it.<p>
<p>Every province has a storage for resources produced by buildings placed in it. Maximum capacity is a sum of buildings' capacities. Production values (gains) are also defined by particular buildings. They are only five building slots in any province so you have to build wisely.<p>
<p>When you place a mouse over a building you will see a menu of options. You can create a building, upgrade or destroy it when you already have one. Choosing a create / upgrade option will open a window with details so you can decide which building will give the best gains for you province, and how much it costs.<p>
