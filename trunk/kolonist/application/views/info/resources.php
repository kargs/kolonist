<p>There are seven types of resources in the game: settlers, soldiers, armament, food, wood, iron and brick. Settlers are the citizens of your provinces. They are needed to do anything. They eat food. Soldiers are the militarized settlers and they fight for you. Soldiers eat more food. Armament is needed for soldiers to fight efectively. Wood, iron and brick are used to build various buildings.</p>
<p>You can check the resources produced by any building, its requirements (costs) and storage capacity in the building creation or upgrade dialog window in the game.</p>
