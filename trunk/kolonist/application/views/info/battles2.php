<p>Please note that the armament / soldiers ratio is constant for particular province. For example, if your province has 50 soldiers and 10 armament, your ratio won't improve if you send only 10 soldiers to the battle! Also note, that the armament bonus is not linear. For extremely big ratio values, the bonus gain grows more and more slowly.</p>
<p>Basically armament and soldiers defines your attack value. The attack from each army you send to the battle is summed. Your attack value is compared against the defense value of victim's province. For the defender also the province's buildings add to the defense value. Each building type and level adds some defense. So, if the victim's army is weaker than yours, you can still loose the fight if the buildings are strong. Unowned provinces doesn't have any buildings, but they do have some soldiers and armament. So they have some defense value, but not much.</p>
