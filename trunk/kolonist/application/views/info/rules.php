<p>The Kolonist is a multiplayer browser-based strategy game in which many players compete to control the biggest part of the map.</p>
<p>The world map of the game is divided into 175 provinces. New player is assigned to one province with little resources at the start.
 Each province has 5 slots for buildings. There are 9 types of buildings, like townhall, bakery, barracks and more. Each building
 produces some amounts of resources and requires some of these in order to be built. The player has to manage his or her provinces
 in a way which ensures good defense (in order to protect agains other players' army) and good attack (in order to take over other
 provinces).</p>
