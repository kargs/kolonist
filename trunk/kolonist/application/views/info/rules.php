<p>The main goal of the game is to take over as many provinces as possible. Players strive to achieve that by creating an army to attack other provinces as well as to defend their own parts of the world. In order to produce the strongest army player has to manage production and consumption of resources (like food, iron or wood) in an optimal way by creating the right buildings in a right time. Many factors have to be taken into account.</p>
