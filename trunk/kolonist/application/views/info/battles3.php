<p>And of course, there is the luck. Luck occurs sometimes and can change the fight result totally. If the difference between your attack and victim's defense is big (in either way), the chance for luck to occur is very low. The same is for the opposite - for equal armies it is very likely that the fight will be solved by luck. If the luck occurs, it adds bonus points for either you or the victim. If there is a big difference in attack / defense ratio and still luck is taking place (which is very unlikely), it will most probably add bonus for the weaker side and can even make it the winner, or at least it will lower the losses.</p>
<p>Losses are pretty big usually. If you are much stronger than the victim, you can loose at least about 20% of troops sent (victim looses at most 80%). But there is the luck factor too - it can change this value even by 20%. It works in a such way that if you are a very strong one, it is likely that it will lower your losses, and it is unlikely that it will rise your losses. For the weaker one it works the opposite. But if the armies have similar force, both you and the victim will loose about 50% of troops +/- 10% of luck bonus.</p>
